Node.js Backend with MongoDB Integration Documentation
===============================
1. Introduction
This documentation aims to guide developers in building a robust and scalable Node.js backend integrated with MongoDB. The backend includes features such as user authentication, user profile management, post creation, commenting system, comprehensive error handling, and logging.

2. Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

models: Contains database models (e.g., User, Post, Comment).
routes: Includes route files for different functionalities (e.g., auth, user, profile, posts, comments).
middleware: Holds middleware functions (e.g., error handling).
app.js/index.js: Main entry point for the Express application.
.env: Configuration file for environment variables.
Other folders: Additional folders for utilities, tests, etc., based on project requirements.

3. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js installed
MongoDB installed or MongoDB Atlas account
Configuration
Create a .env file based on .env.example.
Set environment variables including PORT, MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.
MongoDB Setup
Connect to your MongoDB instance.
Create a new database for the project.

4. Implementation Details
User Authentication
Implemented user registration, login, and optionally, logout.
Used JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing.
MongoDB Integration
Connected Node.js application to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Implemented models for User, Post, and Comment entities.
User Profile Management
Developed routes to manage user profiles (view, update).
Post Creation and Retrieval
Created routes for creating posts and retrieving posts.
Commenting System
Implemented functionality to add comments to posts and retrieve comments.
Error Handling and Logging
Implemented comprehensive error handling using middleware.
Utilized logging with Winston for better error tracking and debugging.

5. Best Practices
Followed RESTful API principles for route structuring.
Encapsulated logic into middleware for reusability.
Implemented input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Used environment variables and kept sensitive information secure.
Employed async/await for asynchronous operations and error handling.
Ensured proper status codes and error messages for responses.

6. Conclusion
This documentation provides a detailed guide on setting up, implementing, and adhering to best practices for developing a Node.js backend with MongoDB integration. For further assistance, refer to the project repository or contact project maintainers.
